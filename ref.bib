abstract = {Overall, cancer is a highly preventable disease. Indeed, modifiable external factors, discovered by epidemiological studies during the last 50 years, account for a majority of all cancer deaths. In this review, we discuss briefly these factors and their contribution to the current burden of cancer with an emphasis on the developed countries. Needless to say, tobacco smoking remains the largest contributor to the cancer landscape, whilst the contribution of poor diet and obesity may be equally important, but much more difficult to quantify. Our main goal was to assess what prevention of cancer has accomplished and might accomplish in the next two decades. Based on (necessarily crude) estimates, age-adjusted mortality rates from cancer in year 2000 had been reduced by approximately 13\% due to primary prevention and an additional 6\% due to the combined effect of early diagnosis and screening (secondary prevention). According to a realistic goal for the year 2020, a further 29\% reduction might be achieved by primary, and 4\% by secondary prevention. The main contribution to such accomplishments would be a reduction in tobacco smoking, improvements in diet—including reduced alcohol intake—and arrest of the obesity epidemic, in part through increased physical exercise. Rather than being granted, these goals require great effort and major commitment from all those who share responsibility for public health.}

    abstract = "{Randomized trials involving large numbers of people and long follow-up have helped measure the mortality reductions achievable by screening for cancer. However, in many of these trials, the reported reductions have been modest. Part of the reason is the inappropriate way the reductions have been calculated. Analyses have largely ignored the fact that there is a time window in the first several years after screening begins in which there cannot be a sizable mortality reduction, followed by one in which the reductions become evident, and—unless screening is continued—a third window in which mortality rates in the screened group revert to those in the unscreened group. This review uses time-specific mortality ratios to address the timing and extent of the reductions achieved in trials of screening for prostate, breast, and colorectal cancer. The author finds that the mortality reductions reported in the literature have substantially underestimated what might be accomplished with continued screening. The natural history of the disease, the frequency of screening, and the duration of follow-up determine the time patterns in the reductions observed in trials. Without appropriate analyses, results from cancer screening trials will be distorted.}",
